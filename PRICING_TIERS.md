## Monetization Strategy Notes

### Recommended Approach: Freemium with Usage Limits

The most effective monetization strategy for MODUS is limiting AI usage on the free tier rather than locking entire features behind the paywall. This approach lets free users experience every feature at least once, creating a "taste and upgrade" flow.

### Key Conversion Triggers (Free → Pro)

1. **Daily AI limit hit** — Show a friendly modal: "You've used 5/5 analyses today. Upgrade to Pro for 50/day."
2. **Real-time data teaser** — Show delayed prices with a small "(15m delay)" badge and an upgrade nudge.
3. **Daily Pick delay** — Show yesterday's pick with "Today's pick is available for Pro users."
4. **Journal limit** — When approaching 50 trades: "You're at 45/50 trades. Pro gives you unlimited."
5. **Watchlist limit** — Show "Upgrade to track more than 10 symbols."

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP Monetization):**
- Add usage counters to AI endpoints (analyses, questions)
- Add daily limit checks client-side with upgrade modals
- Implement Stripe subscription (3 tiers)
- Add tier badge to user profile/sidebar

**Phase 2 (Feature Gating):**
- Gate real-time vs delayed data by tier
- Gate SMS alerts by tier
- Gate export functionality by tier
- Add upgrade prompts at natural friction points

**Phase 3 (Growth):**
- Referral program (give a friend 1 week Pro)
- Annual billing discount (save 33%)
- Student discount (50% off with .edu email)
- 7-day free Pro trial for new signups

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Users | Free (80%) | Pro (15%) | Elite (5%) | Monthly Revenue |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1,000 | 800 | 150 | 50 | $3,748 |
| 5,000 | 4,000 | 750 | 250 | $18,748 |
| 10,000 | 8,000 | 1,500 | 500 | $37,498 |
| 50,000 | 40,000 | 7,500 | 2,500 | $187,475 |

### Cost Considerations

- **AI API costs** are the primary expense. Each analysis uses ~2K tokens ($0.003-0.01 per analysis). At 50 analyses/day for Pro users, that's ~$0.25/user/day or $7.50/month — well within the $14.99 price.
- **Data APIs** (Yahoo Finance) are free but rate-limited. May need paid data source for Elite tier (Alpha Vantage Premium or Polygon.io).
- **Hosting** (Vercel) — free tier handles significant traffic. Pro plan ($20/mo) needed at ~10K users.
