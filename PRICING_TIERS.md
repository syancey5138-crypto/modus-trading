## Monetization Strategy Notes

### Recommended Approach: Freemium with Usage Limits

The most effective monetization strategy for MODUS is limiting AI usage on the free tier rather than locking entire features behind the paywall. This approach lets free users experience every feature at least once, creating a "taste and upgrade" flow.

### Key Conversion Triggers (Free → Pro)

1. **Daily AI limit hit** — Show a friendly modal: "You've used 5/5 analyses today. Upgrade to Pro for 50/day."
2. **Real-time data teaser** — Show delayed prices with a small "(15m delay)" badge and an upgrade nudge.
3. **Daily Pick delay** — Show yesterday's pick with "Today's pick is available for Pro users."
4. **Journal limit** — When approaching 50 trades: "You're at 45/50 trades. Pro gives you unlimited."
5. **Watchlist limit** — Show "Upgrade to track more than 10 symbols."

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP Monetization):**
- Add usage counters to AI endpoints (analyses, questions)
- Add daily limit checks client-side with upgrade modals
- Implement Stripe subscription (3 tiers)
- Add tier badge to user profile/sidebar

**Phase 2 (Feature Gating):**
- Gate real-time vs delayed data by tier
- Gate SMS alerts by tier
- Gate export functionality by tier
- Add upgrade prompts at natural friction points

**Phase 3 (Growth):**
- Referral program (give a friend 1 week Pro)
- Annual billing discount (save 33%)
- Student discount (50% off with .edu email)
- 7-day free Pro trial for new signups

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Users | Free (80%) | Pro (15%) | Elite (5%) | Monthly Revenue |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1,000 | 800 | 150 | 50 | $3,748 |
| 5,000 | 4,000 | 750 | 250 | $18,748 |
| 10,000 | 8,000 | 1,500 | 500 | $37,498 |
| 50,000 | 40,000 | 7,500 | 2,500 | $187,475 |

### Cost Considerations

- **AI API costs** are the primary expense. Each analysis uses ~2K tokens ($0.003-0.01 per analysis). At 50 analyses/day for Pro users, that's ~$0.25/user/day or $7.50/month — well within the $14.99 price.
- **Data APIs** (Yahoo Finance) are free but rate-limited. May need paid data source for Elite tier (Alpha Vantage Premium or Polygon.io).
- **Hosting** (Vercel) — free tier handles significant traffic. Pro plan ($20/mo) needed at ~10K users.

## Detailed Monetization Breakdown

### Payment Infrastructure

**Recommended Stack:**
- **Stripe** for payment processing (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)
- **Stripe Billing** for subscription management (recurring billing, proration, upgrades/downgrades)
- **Stripe Customer Portal** so users can manage their own subscription (cancel, change plan, update card)
- **Firebase Custom Claims** to store tier info in the auth token (checked client-side for instant access control)
- **Webhook verification** — Stripe sends events (subscription created, payment failed, cancelled) to your Vercel API endpoint, which updates Firestore user doc with `tier: "pro"` or `tier: "elite"`

**Implementation Flow:**
1. User clicks "Upgrade" → opens Stripe Checkout (hosted page, no PCI compliance needed)
2. Stripe processes payment → sends webhook to `/api/stripe-webhook`
3. Webhook handler verifies signature → updates Firestore: `users/{uid}.tier = "pro"`
4. Frontend reads tier from Firestore on login → unlocks features immediately
5. Stripe handles all recurring billing, failed payments, dunning emails automatically

### Feature-Level Access Control

| Feature | Free | Pro | Elite | Gate Type |
|---------|------|-----|-------|-----------|
| Chart Analysis | 5/day | 50/day | Unlimited | Counter (Firestore) |
| Quick Analysis | 5/day | 50/day | Unlimited | Counter (Firestore) |
| Ask AI | 10/day | 50/day | Unlimited | Counter (Firestore) |
| Tell Me More | 2/day | 20/day | Unlimited | Counter (Firestore) |
| Ask About Chart | None | 20/day | Unlimited | Hard gate |
| Daily Pick | Yesterday's | Today's | Today's + Mid-day | Time gate |
| Data Refresh | 15-min delay | Real-time | Real-time + extended | Config flag |
| Multi-Timeframe | None | 3 timeframes | Unlimited | Hard gate |
| Paper Trading | None | $100K account | $100K account | Hard gate |
| Portfolio Tracker | None | 30 positions | Unlimited | Counter |
| Trading Journal | 50 trades | Unlimited | Unlimited | Counter |
| Watchlist | 10 symbols | 50 symbols | Unlimited | Counter |
| Price Alerts | 5 alerts | 25 + email | Unlimited + SMS | Counter + channel |
| PDF Export | None | Basic | Branded | Hard gate |

| Alert Performance | None | None | Full analytics | Hard gate |

| Economic Calendar | None | Basic | AI impact analysis | Hard gate |

### Counter Implementation (Firestore)

Each user document tracks daily usage:
```
users/{uid}/dailyUsage/{YYYY-MM-DD}: {
  chartAnalyses: 3,
  quickAnalyses: 2,
  askAiQuestions: 7,
  tellMeMore: 1,
  imageAnalyses: 0,
  lastReset: "2026-02-07T00:00:00Z"
}
```

A Cloud Function resets counters at midnight UTC. Client-side checks before each AI call:
- Read counter from Firestore
- Compare to tier limit
- If over: show upgrade modal instead of calling API
- If under: proceed and increment counter

### Upgrade Modal Design

When a user hits a limit, show a non-intrusive modal:
- **Header:** "You've reached your daily limit"
- **Body:** "You've used 5/5 Quick Analyses today. Upgrade to Pro for 50/day — or come back tomorrow for 5 more."
- **CTA:** "Upgrade to Pro — $14.99/mo" (gradient button)
- **Secondary:** "View all plans" (text link)
- **Dismiss:** "Maybe later" (subtle X)

### Pricing Psychology

**Why $14.99 and $29.99:**
- $14.99 is below the psychological $15 threshold — feels like "a little over $10"
- $29.99 is below $30 — positions as "about $1/day" which is cheap for a trading tool
- The jump from $14.99 to $29.99 is only 2x, but Elite gets "unlimited everything" — makes it feel like a steal for power users
- Competitors (TradingView, TrendSpider, Trade Ideas) charge $30-$100/month — MODUS is positioned as the affordable AI-first alternative

**Annual Pricing:**
- Pro Annual: $119.99/year (saves $59.89 = 33% off, equivalent to $10/month)
- Elite Annual: $239.99/year (saves $119.89 = 33% off, equivalent to $20/month)
- Show savings prominently: "Save $60/year" badge next to annual toggle

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Price Range | Key Difference |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| TradingView | $14.95-$59.95/mo | Charts only, no AI analysis |
| TrendSpider | $39-$79/mo | Automated technical analysis, expensive |
| Trade Ideas | $84-$167/mo | AI-driven, but enterprise-priced |
| Stock Rover | $7.99-$27.99/mo | Fundamentals-focused, no AI |
| MODUS | Free-$29.99/mo | AI-first, modern UI, beginner-friendly |

**MODUS competitive edge:** Free tier exists (competitors don't offer meaningful free tiers), AI-powered analysis at every level, modern dark UI, beginner-friendly with educational content (glossary, tips, tooltips).

### Growth Levers

**Referral Program (Phase 3):**
- Referrer gets 1 week of Pro free for each signup
- Referred friend gets 7-day Pro trial
- Cap at 4 weeks accumulated (1 month free max)
- Track referrals via unique invite code stored in Firestore

**Upsell Moments (Natural friction points):**
1. After a user's first successful analysis → "Love the analysis? Pro gives you 50/day"
2. When Daily Pick says "Available for Pro users" → clear value demonstration
3. After logging 45+ trades → "Almost at your limit — upgrade for unlimited"
4. When a user tries Multi-Timeframe for the first time (locked) → "This is a Pro feature — try it free for 7 days"
5. After viewing a winning trade in paper trading (locked) → "Track real trades with paper money — upgrade to Pro"

**Retention Strategy:**
- Monthly "MODUS Wrapped" email — your trading stats, best picks, improvement areas
- Weekly AI market summary email (Pro+)
- New feature announcements drive re-engagement
- Streak system (Trading Streak widget) gamifies daily usage
